📌 Project Prompt: MERN Stack Talent App Backend + Dashboard Integration
🧩 Project Overview:
We are building the backend for a Talent App using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The frontend is already designed in React. We need to:

Create a secure login flow with predefined credentials.

Develop a dashboard with a sidebar and modular CRUD functionalities.

Handle file uploads using Multer.

Update the frontend routing and components to support forms, modals, and data tables for each section.

🔐 Authentication (Login):
Frontend:

Add a Login button to the Navbar on the homepage.

Clicking it will navigate to /login route.

Create a LoginPage component with a form (Username & Password).

Backend:

Use JWT-based authentication.

Only one set of hardcoded credentials:

Username: Bavneet1212x

Password: OkBavneet

On successful login, return a token and redirect to /dashboard.

📊 Dashboard Page (After Login):
Route: /dashboard

Layout:

Sidebar with the following links:

Internships (/dashboard/internships)

Job Cards (/dashboard/jobs)

BootCamps (/dashboard/bootcamps)

Post Grad (/dashboard/postgrad)

Global Programs (/dashboard/global)

Master Classes (/dashboard/masterclasses)

Logout

Main Content Area showing:

“Create” button ➝ opens form in Modal.

Table showing submitted entries with file previews and data.

🗃️ Data Models and Form Schema:
Each section will have its own MongoDB schema, API routes (POST, GET, DELETE), and Multer integration for file uploads (images, banners).

🧠 Frontend Enhancements:
Add React Routes for each section (Internships, Jobs, etc.)

On each section:

Show “Create” button ➝ opens Modal Form.

Upon submission, data is POSTed to the backend, saved in MongoDB, and re-rendered in a table with preview.

Use React-Bootstrap or Material UI modals.

Use axios for API calls.

Show file/image preview after upload.

Add loading and error states.

🧾 File Uploads:
Use Multer in backend to handle:

Internship Banners

Job Banners

Bootcamp & Course Banners

Store file path in MongoDB.

Save uploaded files in /uploads/ directory and serve them statically.

⚙️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: React, React Router, Axios, Bootstrap/Material UI

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

File Upload: Multer
